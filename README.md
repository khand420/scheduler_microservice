# Scheduler Microservice

## Overview
This microservice allows scheduling jobs with customizable configurations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. Start Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A scheduler_microservice worker -l info
   ```
7. Start Celery beat:
   ```bash
   celery -A scheduler_microservice beat -l info
   ```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/jobs/`: List all jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}/`: Get job details by ID
- `POST /api/jobs/`: Create a new job

 ## Scalability:

    To make your application scalable to handle the complexity you described (~10,000 users, ~1,000 services, and ~6,000 API requests per minute), you need to consider both architectural and code-level optimizations.

    **Architectural Considerations:**

    - **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your application. This helps to manage high traffic loads and ensures the application can scale horizontally.

    - **Database Optimization:**
      - Use a powerful RDBMS like PostgreSQL with read replicas for handling read-heavy loads.
      - Implement proper indexing on your database tables to speed up queries, especially on columns that are frequently filtered or sorted.

    - **Caching:**
      - Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to cache frequent queries, API responses, and static assets. This will reduce the load on your database and backend services.
      - Django supports caching out-of-the-box, and you can use `django-redis` to integrate Redis caching.

    - **Asynchronous Processing:**
      - Offload heavy tasks (e.g., sending emails, processing data) to background workers using Celery. This prevents your application from being blocked by long-running tasks.
      - You can also configure Celery to work with a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis and ensure the workers can be scaled up as needed.

    - **Auto-Scaling:**
      - Use AWS Auto Scaling or a similar service to automatically increase or decrease the number of application instances based on traffic patterns. This ensures your application can handle sudden traffic spikes without manual intervention.

    - **API Rate Limiting:**
      - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API endpoints. Django provides middleware for rate limiting via third-party packages like `django-ratelimit`.

    **Code-Level Optimizations:**

    - **Efficient Database Queries:**
      - Avoid N+1 query problems by using `select_related` or `prefetch_related` in your Django queries to optimize database access.
      - Keep queries as efficient as possible, using aggregates, bulk operations, and careful filtering.

    - **Pagination:**
      - For endpoints that return lists (like `/jobs`), implement pagination to avoid returning large datasets at once. Django Rest Framework provides built-in support for pagination.

    **Scaling Celery Workers:**
    - Ensure Celery workers are distributed and can be scaled independently. This is important for handling a large number of background jobs.

    **Deployment Pipeline:**
    - Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments and ensure that your application can be rolled out across multiple servers without downtime.
    - Consider containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes to manage your deployments at scale.

    **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch for monitoring the performance of your application and setting up alerts in case of any issues.

By implementing these features, your Django application will not only be customizable and flexible but also highly scalable and ready to handle large-scale deployments.
